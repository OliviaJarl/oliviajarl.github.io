    about1: "This was an individual project I did in a graphical interfaces course. The task was to design an interface for booking rooms and equipment at a university, and the user group is teachers and students. Each item should hold data on name and location, and the room items should also include data on size and available equipment, such as projectors and whiteboards. A booking should hold data on who made the booking, the date and time, and whether the administrator has approved the booking.",
    about2: "A critical aspect of the booking system is managing the balance between automatic booking and manual control. For example, a teacher must book two rooms on Tuesday afternoons for three weeks. All rooms must hold at least 20 people and be within five minutes of walking distance. The teacher defines the requirements for the booking by using search and filtering mechanisms, and the system suggests a list of rooms and dates/times. The teacher reviews this and is generally satisfied, but she knows that one room is unsuitable for the occasion. Manually, she selects another room that she knows is better, which the system also shows is available.",
